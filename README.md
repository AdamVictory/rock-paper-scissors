# Features 

### Common Features
The common elements across all four pages of the website are the Header and Footer sections. 
+ The Header - This section appears at the top of all pages and consists of a gif logo which sits on the left, and a navigation 
menu which is on the right. The logo and menu will adjust on different sized screens. It is clear to the user which page they are on due to the underline in the navigation menu. Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home, About, Menu and Contact pages. It is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation. This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. It includes a gif logo which makes the website modern. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/navigation-bar.png">

+ The Footer - This section appears on the very bottom of all pages. It contains four social media icons which can take the user to the necessary social platform. It also contains copyright information. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/footer.png">


### Home Page
This is will be the first page a user sees when they open the website. It is also the page that the user will be taken to if they click on the gif logo. The home pages consits of the following: 
+ Hero Image - This image covers the whole width of the page and has an animaiton effect so it's the first thing the user sees. It 
consists of the restuarants name and also some abstract designs to give it a modern look. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/banner-image.png">

+ Welcome Text - This section is underneath the hero image. It was added to make the user feel welcome to the website. It also contains some text on how to use the website effectively through the use of shortcut links. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/welcome.png">

+ Video - This section contains a high quality video of Tacos being prepared by a chef. It gives the user an idea of how the tacos look and are prepared. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/video.png">

+ Why Our Tacos - This section allows the user to see the benefits of the restaurant and why they should eat there. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/why-our-tacos.png">

+ Call-to-action Boxes - This is the fifth and final section of the home page. It consists of three boxes and links to add another method of accessing the different pages of the website. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/call-to-action.png">

### About Page
This is the second page of the websites and is used to tell the Owners story and give a brief history of their restuarant. 
I used one high quality image of the owners to show how they are a family business. This makes the user feel that they are genuine and gives them more confidence eating there. I also included a quote from Lovin Dublin to add even more confidence. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/about-us.png">


### Menu Page
This page is used to list all of the food items available on their menu and their prices. I wanted to keep this simple so the focus would be on the food and it is very easy to read while scrolling down. The sections in the page are small plates, tacos, vegan tacos, cocktails, red wine, white wine and beer. I didn't want to overstyle this as I think it's easier to read the way it is. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/menu.png">

### Contact Page
This page effectively shows all the different methods the user can get in touch with the restuarant.There are three different sections to the contact page. 
+ General Information -  It also has a contact form and google maps embeded. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/contact-us.png">

+ Contact Form - Allows the user to submit their details and questions.

## Features Left to Implement

+ If I had more time I would have added two buttons. One called "Order Delivery" and "Book a Table", first one links to deliveroos website and the other links to resmio.

# Testing

## Cross-Browser Testing 
I tested the website across 3 web browsers that are Mozilla Firefox, Google chrome and Safari. The site worked on all of these web broswers. 
I tested the website, it is responsive and functions well o using Google Dev Tools except it is not as a good on the iphone. 


## Compatibility Testing 
I tested on many different devices such as Apple Macbook pro, Dell laptop, Apple Ipad, Samsung Galaxy phone. No major issues were found. All of the text is readable, understandable and has good contrast. The form is easy to use and works. All social links open correctly. 


## Responsiveness Testing 
I used Google Chromes developer tools to test thee responsiveness of the website throughout development. I designed the website for different screen sizes such as 800px (medium screen size), 600px (small screen size) annd 400px (ultra small screen size). 

### The Header 
Once the viewport is below the width of 800px the navigation menu stacks underneath the logo. I had to adjsut the margin and padding to make it look better. It spans the full width of the page. Once the width of the screen is reduced the navigation menu stacks below the logo.
 <img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/smaller-header.png">

### The Footer 
The footer does not contain a lot of text therefore it worked on all screen sizes. It stayed the same on all screen sizes. 


### The Banner 
The banner image only appears on the homepage. On smaller screen sizes it was too tall and not wide enough.  


### Homepage - Welcome text, video, call to action panels
The welcome text on the homepage sits in the center and looks good for all screen sizes. Similarily the video sits nicely in the center of both pages. 
The call to action panels on a screen size of 800px or less changes to a single column. 



### About Page
This page performed very well as it's a heading, parapragh and a center image so it did not need to be adapted for different screens. 


### Menu Page
Similiar to the about page, this was mainly HTML and was in the center so it did not need to be changed for smaller screens. I really like this page and how easy it is to read. 


### Contact Page
I had to make the width and height of the google maps box smaller but once I did this it worked for all screens. 

## User Testing 
The navigation was clearly accessible on all screens but the small iphone. All information was presented clearly with contrasting backgrounds. 
The simplicity of the website makes it very easy to view and navigate through. 

## Validator Testing 

+ HTML
  - One error was found, I do not think it is an error though. [W3C validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fadamvictory.github.io%2FOaxaca-Taco-Bar%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
+ CSS
  - A few errors were found here but I don't think it has an effect on the overall CSS [(Jigsaw) validator] (https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fadamvictory.github.io%2FOaxaca-Taco-Bar%2Findex.html)


## Performance Testing 
I tested the website using Lighthouse through Google Chrome Developer Tools. I am satisifies with all of the results expect for the homepage. The iphones performance dragged this down.

<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/performance-menu.png">

### Unfixed Bugs

+ On smaller screens a lot of the images and text overlapped. 
+ Spelling mistakes were found but fixed before deployment. 
+ It says there is an issue with my </a> on line 22 but I couldn't find out why. 

### Issues and Resolutions

+ I ran into the issue of not having enough time to make my content look good on the iphone. If I had more time I would have resolved this issue.
+ Apply more buttons to the site, linking users to order on deliveroo or make a booking through resmio. 
+ More features within the footer linking the user to different pages. 
+ I couldn't resize the video to fit for ultra small screen. 



## Deployment

+ The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - Used the Code Institutes Template 
  - Named my github repository
  - Installed Gitpod google chrome extension 
  - Began to push changes to my GitHub repository
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
